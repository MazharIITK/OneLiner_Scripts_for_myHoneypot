# Lits of one liner bash scripts which will help to explore my Honeypot:

1) **To count the number of different IPs which attacked my Honeypot** 
	
	$:~ _echo */ | wc_


2) **To list all IPs which have attacked my Honeypots 'n' number of times. (Put any value in place of 'n')**

	
	$:~ _find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec bash -c "echo -ne '{} '; ls '{}' | wc -l" \; | >  awk '$NF>=1000'_
	
	
	**Note:** Here, I have put n = 1000, you can put any value of 'n' of your choice.

3) **To determine ones public IP.**
	
	$:~ _curl ipinfo.io/ip_
	
	**Note:** This was used when I was trying to attack my Honeypot from my own system and see if a directory with my IP was
	      created or not.

4) **This will print the number of files(attacks) in each directory(IP).**

	$:~ _du -a | cut -d/ -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr_
	
	**Note:** This helped me to know how many attacks were made by each IP on my Honeypot.

5) **This will show all the IPs and their attaempts of attacks in files sorted by LAST EDITED DATE**

	$:~ _ls -Rt_
	
	**Note:** Here, -R means recursive (include subdirectories) and -t means "sort by last modification date".
